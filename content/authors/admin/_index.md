Hello world, I'm Alma, a computational biologist who loves to explore ways of
describing biological systems and their processes by using models based on
statistical inference and machine learning. My work is usually applied to
problems relating to single cell or spatial transcriptomics data, but I'm
excited about computational methods in general, especially generative
probabilistic models. Science is awesome and only comes second to my big passion
in life, running. Also, Linux is my jam.
