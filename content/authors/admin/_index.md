I'm a PhD student in the [Lundeberg Lab](https://www.spatialresearch.org/), situated at SciLifeLab (Stockholm, Sweden) focusing on computational method development. I've always
been fascinated with how mathematical models can be used to explain much of the richness found in complex systems (biological and non-biological) but also to enhance our understanding of their
characteristics and behaviour; a fascination that - for the better or worse - tend to influence my research quite substantially. My second big passion is running, the farther the better, whether it's
for transportation or pure pleasure - nothing can quite compare to it.
