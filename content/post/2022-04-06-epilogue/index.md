On the 18th of March 2022 I defended my PhD thesis: _"Computational methods for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data"_. About a month before this date, I
finalized the actual document to be defended. Having spent a considerable amount
of time writing the thesis, I had two realizations upon submission: (1) aside
from my supervisor, the opponent, and my thesis committee - only a handful
people would at most read this thing I've worked so hard to compile; (2) the
part I deemed most valuable was the _Epilogue_, where I
took the freedom to share some personal insights from these years.

Hence, I've decided to post an excerpt from the Epilogue here on the website. I
like it not because it's a literary masterpiece (it most certainly is not), but
because it contains advice I wish I had known when starting my PhD. It consists
of three parts:

- **What I've learnt** : lessons learnt from my time as a PhD
- **What I predict** : some humble prediction about the future
- **What I hope** : hopes for the future 

For anyone interested in the full thesis, it can be found [here](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1639545&dswid=4029).

What I've learnt
================

The *"end of history illusion"* is a phenomenon in psychology where
individuals agree that up until the current point in time they've
experienced continuous and significant growth, but believe that,
henceforth, they will not change by any considerable amount. This
illusion is persistent across all ages, and repeatedly proven to be
incorrect. We humans are malleable and never seem to solidify. No matter
where in life we are, we continue to develop, change, and grow.\
\
I was convinced that I'd learn a lot during my PhD, scientifically --
but would I be affected on a personal level? Most likely not. Despite me
being aware of the aforementioned illusion, I was impermeable to the
idea that this experience would leave much of an imprint on me. I guess
that this is at its best described as arrogance and at its worst as
stupidity.\
\
Starting my PhD on the 12:th of June 2019, I've spent exactly 1010 days
-- or 2 years, 9 months, and 6 days -- pursuing my degree. This time has
been nothing short of transformative. Agreeably, approximately three
years is not a huge amount of time, but these years have been densely
packed with new experiences, encounters, and impressions. I've acquired
many new skills, but I also leave this era of my life as a very
different person than the one who entered it. Below follows a curated
list of insights that I've collected over the course of my PhD, relating
to science as well as personal topics.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**A high level of complexity does not equal a high level of
    success**</span>. Among computational methods, it's rarely the most
    advanced methods that surface as the most popular ones. If you
    desire spread and impact, study the field, seek questions that are
    frequently being asked but rarely answered; then tailor your method
    towards this. Never develop a method and *then* invent a question
    for it to address.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Develop for you audience, not yourself**</span>. If you're capable of
    formulating a statistical or mathematical model, and then implement
    it in code, you are likely more proficient in these areas than the
    average user of your tool. Therefore, if you want people to use your
    software, make the interface intuitive and provide a layman's
    explanation of how it works. Good documentation with loads of
    examples is key to success. If possible, integrate your method into
    already existing frameworks, this makes it easy for users to explore
    without having to learn a new syntax. From my experience, methods
    that are easy to operate are often favored over less user friendly
    ones, even though the latter might have much better performance.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Listen to people when they complain**</span>. If someone expresses that
    they are struggling with something, they are likely not alone.
    Embrace the opportunity and be the one to deliver the solution. This
    is one of the easiest ways to identify areas where you can make a
    useful contribution.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Seek diversity and honor others' expertise**</span>. The best
    collaborations are those where the people involved have
    complementary strengths and show mutual respect for each other's
    skills. There's a difference to being proud of your expertise and
    being arrogant about it. A project thrives when the members don't
    consider their own contribution more (or less) important than anyone
    else's, but acknowledge that everyone is essential for the process
    to move forward.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Time spent planning is often doubly rewarded.**</span> I'm addicted to
    fast progress, but have learnt that a short pause can save plenty of
    time. Making informed design choices, and not just blindly throwing
    yourself at the first idea, almost always results in a more pleasant
    and faster overall process. A quick fix for the situation at hand
    might seem tempting, but adapting general solutions usually pays off
    in the end.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Garbage data will give you garbage results**</span>. You wouldn't pick up
    a roadkill, cook it, and then expect it to taste like a dish from a
    Michelin star restaurant. The same should hold true for data; one
    needs to have reasonable expectations about what information that
    can be derived from it. There's a difference between a
    bioinformat*ician* and a mag*ician*, the latter can turn nothing
    into something, the former cannot. Sometimes, the data is just not
    good enough to answer certain questions, if such is the case, there
    are only two reasonable options: (i) ask a different question,
    or (ii) generate new data.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Don't bring nuclear weapons to a gun fight.**</span> Sometimes enthusiasm
    and excitement about new powerful methods makes us blind to the fact
    that the problem at hand likely could be solved with simpler means.
    For some questions, a simple regression model will do just as fine
    -- and possibly even better -- than a fancy deep learning model.
    It's easy to be caught up in the storm of buzz words, but take some
    time to contemplate what level of complexity your problem actually
    requires.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Aim to be the dumbest person in the room**.</span> The best way to grow
    is to position yourself in an environment where people are more
    skilled than yourself, it accelerates learning and forces you to be
    alert. Comfort is truly the enemy of improvement.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm**.</span> I believe one
    should always strive to help others when we can, but at some point,
    it can also become problematic. If you *consistently* are the one
    who does the extra work, covers for others, and stays late -- then
    you're not helping, you're being taken advantage of. We're all
    familiar with the airplane safety instructions telling us to put on
    our own masks before helping someone else, this is equally
    applicable to the workplace. If you want to have a positive impact
    on the people around you, the most important thing is that you feel
    good about your own situation.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Never compromise on health**.</span> In January 2021 I experienced
    something close to a physical collapse, my body simply quit on me. I
    could barely walk for two months, and for six more months, every day
    of my life felt like a living hell -- I did not enjoy living. Every
    morning, I put on an alarm that counted down the hours that I had
    left to be awake and aware of my situation. Still, when night came,
    I barely slept. Instead, I woke up multiple times having issues
    breathing or in a state of complete sleep paralysis. A combination
    of bad nutrition, an extreme (according to some people) amount of
    exercise, and working ten to twelve hours a day (including weekends)
    put me in a state of severe exhaustion. It was not until I became a
    prisoner of my own body that I realized how much my previous freedom
    meant to me. It's hard realizing that you're not an exception, but
    just as human as everyone else. However, in the end, this
    realization is healthy. If there's one thing I will bring with me
    from these years, it's that *nothing* is worth sacrificing one's
    well-being or health for.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Perspective is everything.**</span> There's a quote from the, truly
    awful, series *"Pirates of the Caribbean"* that reads: *"The problem
    is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the
    problem."* Even though I cringe just by thinking about Captain Jack
    Sparrow, these words have stayed with me. I've experienced first
    hand how you can't plan every aspect of life. Unexpected things can,
    and will, happen. Our attitude determines how we experience these
    events, whether it becomes a tragedy or a lesson. I've tried to
    adopt more of a "gratitude mindset"; instead of being frustrated
    when things don't go my way, I try to celebrate what has gone right
    so far. This attitude is not always easy to maintain, and one is of
    course allowed to feel anger, but it's a feeling that becomes toxic
    if we let it linger for too long. Implementing this mindset have
    made me a much happier individual and helped me through some really
    dark times.

What I predict
==============

In 2016, when the Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technique was published,
I had just finished the second year of my bachelor and was yet to hear
the term "transcriptomics". Thus, I'm acutely aware of the fact that I
belong to the younger generation of the transcriptomics field, and do
not have the same experience as many of my peers. Still, having worked
somewhat intensively in the niche of computational method development
for spatial transcriptomics, I have a few predictions about the future,
which I'll take the freedom to share here.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Deep learning methods will become staple goods**</span>. Although I'm
    fascinated by deep learning (DL) methods, none of my works have so
    far exploited the power of these architectures -- mainly because
    I've felt as if the questions I had could be addressed with simpler
    methods, or because the data wasn't there. However, the trend of
    access to more data, increasingly sophisticated and user friendly
    frameworks -- paired with the development of new kinds of models --
    makes me certain that DL will revolutionize the single cell and
    spatial transcriptomics fields, just as it has many other aspects of
    our life. Currently, a lot of the DL-based methods simply apply
    existing general models (e.g., taken from the natural language
    processing field) to a problem in the transcriptomics sphere.
    However, I believe we'll migrate from this approach towards using
    *bespoke models*, where prior information about the biological
    systems are integrated into the model architecture. In the very near
    future, methods leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and
    their aptitude for irregular data will likely become a popular
    element in many methods for analysis of spatial transcriptomics
    data.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Emergence of perturbation studies.**</span> The majority of publications
    and projects that include spatial transcriptomics data have so far
    been observational. A sample is collected, analyzed, and relevant
    observations presented. At some rare occasions, samples representing
    case and control exist, but usually with limited meta data and no
    control over confounding variables. While interesting, this setup
    mainly permits exploratory data analysis (EDA), but does not lend
    itself well to infer causal relationships. To go beyond mere
    associations or correlations, an intervention or *perturbation* of
    the system is necessary. Thus, I'm certain that it's just a question
    of time until techniques to the likes of Perturb-seq are combined
    with spatial assays. With the introduction of perturbations, we'll
    be able to deduce how gene expression impacts spatial structure, and
    potentially also the reciprocal relationships. With access to such
    data, *causal inference* will likely become an essential tool for
    modeling and understanding causative effects. This is something I'm
    genuinely excited about.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Preference of generative models.**</span> Many of the models we currently
    employ are of a discriminative nature, but I anticipate a shift
    towards *generative models*. Discriminative models assumes some
    functional form of the posterior, in contrast, generative models
    learns the joint probability distribution over all variables.
    Generative models are more susceptible to incorporation of prior
    information about the systems being studied, and better at
    representing causal relationships. Thus, they neatly tie together
    the two previous statement about a need for bespoke models and
    causal links.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Challenges of multimodal analysis.**</span> To me, the trend in
    technology development can best be summarized with the Pokémon
    slogan: *"Gotta Catch 'Em All."* The transcriptome, epigenome,
    proteome, and metabolome -- we want them all, at the same time, from
    the same cell. Alas, 10x Genomics already have an assay where
    RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data from the same cell can be obtained, as
    well as an second assay where spatial RNA-seq information and
    protein abundance are collected simultaneously. Except for increased
    ability to resolve cell types and states, very few examples where
    multimodal data is superior to unimodal data have so far been
    presented, but there's no lack of ideas.\
    \
    One of the commonly mentioned aspirations is to learn relationships
    between the different modalities, which can be used to *predict* one
    modality from another, for example, deducing protein levels from
    gene expression. Here, I will take a somewhat controversial and
    conservative stance by stating that: prediction of one modality from
    another will prove to be more challenging than many expect. I base
    this statement on two concepts: *temporal delays* and *missing
    information*. I'll elaborate on both these issues below.\
    \
    Changes to one part of the central dogma usually don't manifest
    immediately in other parts, some form of delay tends to be present.
    Thus, data ($x_t$) collected from one modality at time $t$
    isn't necessarily informative about the feature values ($y_t$)
    of a different modality at the same time point. Instead -- due to
    the lag -- $x_t$ relates to the values ($y_{t'}$) at a
    later point $t'$. This discrepancy causes an issue in learning,
    because the two modalities are related according to:
    $$y_{t'} = f(x_t)$$
    However, in most multimodal assays, we observe
    $(x_t,y_t)$, meaning the data required to learn $f$ is not
    available. Potentially, $y_{t'}$ could be inferred from
    $y_t$ by learning a second map $g$ such that
    $y_{t'} = g(y_t)$. Then $f$ can be learnt by first
    transforming $y_t$ through $g$. Now, to find $g$, the
    derivative $\partial y_{t}/\partial t$ must likely be deduced.
    To estimate this derivative, at least one more data point close in
    time (w.r.t. protein turnover timescales) is required.
    Unfortunately, experimental assays only capture a single snapshot of
    the system at a particular time. As a consequence, estimation of
    such derivatives is usually infeasible. The dilemma described above
    is what I refer to as temporal delay.\
    \
    Next, I'll address the second caveat, that of missing data. The path
    from one modality to another often involves several steps and
    regulatory mechanisms, not exclusively relying on elements of the
    observed modality. Thus, the previous equation should be updated to:
    $$y_{t'} = f(x_t,u_t)$$
    Where $u_t$ represent entities with an
    influence over the regulatory mechanisms (e.g., enzyme levels or
    metabolic concentrations). Note that it's possible that $u_t$ and
    $y_t$ overlaps. Assuming that the above equation is true, data must also be collected on
    $u_t$ for predictions about $y_{t'}$ to be made, solely
    relying on $x_t$ is not sufficient. Thus, $x_t$ does not
    contain all the information needed to predict $y_t$. Of course,
    if $t \approx t'$ and $f(x_t,u_t) \approx f(x_t)$, the
    problem is reduced to a much simpler one. Still, when such is not
    the case, we should accept that the prediction task is challenging.
    I definitely don't think it's beyond our capabilities, but while I
    expect methods for *integration* of different data modalities to
    emerge soon after the experimental technologies, general methods to
    model intermodal relationships will take more time to mature.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**The group before the individual.**</span> As mentioned in the background, both
    internal and external factors influence a cell's state. In my opinion,
    there's still a need for general methods that tries to model how the local
    environment of a cell affects its behavior. Conditional models for gene
    expression already exist, one example being those that condition on cell
    type, often resulting in sets of marker genes or gene signatures. These
    models could be expanded to also include conditioning on the local
    environment of a cell, for example, the proportion of different cell types
    in its neighborhood. Such models add a new, interconnected, layer of
    information to our understanding of how cells operate in biological systems.
    Indeed, early attempts to construct models of this kind have already been
    made (e.g., node-centric expression modeling by the Theis Lab), and I dare
    to predict an abundance of them in a couple of years from now.

What I hope
===========

Having outlined the lessons I've learnt and my predictions for the
future, only one thing remains: listing some of the thing I hope for,
but am less certain of.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Revised educational programs.**</span> In genomics, almost every new
    technological method is accompanied by a suite of computational
    tools to analyze the data. Ever more frequently, high impact
    journals publish purely computational methods designed to unveil
    previously occluded insights that only emerge by clever modeling of
    the data. Thus, it's evident that computational expertise is just as
    important to advance life science as biological and technical
    knowledge. If further proof is needed, in 2021, SciLifeLab and the
    Wallenberg National Program announced several DDLS (data driven life
    science) fellowships, acknowledging the importance of computational
    competence. Still, the essential skills needed in computational
    biology, such as: statistics, mathematics, probability theory,
    modeling, and programming, are severely underrepresented in many of
    the biotechnology programs at Swedish universities. We need to step
    up our game if we want maintain our status within the life sciences
    as an innovative and leading nation, and remain competitive with
    international institutions like the Broad or the Wellcome Trust
    Sanger Institute. The foundation must be laid early on, educating
    PhD students is not good enough, computational biology tracks should
    be instituted already at the Master level and potentially even seep
    into the bachelor programs. I sincerely hope that the educational
    programs will be updated, to also prepare students -- with an
    interest -- for the challenges a computational biologist faces.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Increased diversity.**</span> If there's one thing I'm not stoked about,
    it's gender quotation and female-exclusive events; to me they have
    an opposite effect of their intended purpose. These actions belittle
    women's competence and give the impression that we need extra help
    or special rules to succeed. However, women are clearly
    underrepresented in the computational field; at many hackathons or
    meetings, I've found myself -- as a woman -- in a very small
    minority, and am often assumed to be someone representing the
    wet-lab side. I'm not upset by this, and have never been met with
    anything but respect when correcting people, but I don't think it
    has to be like this. Girls and young women should be equally
    encouraged to purse STEM subjects as their male counterparts, and
    all of us -- me included -- should probably revise or abolish some
    of our stereotypes. So, I dearly hope for a future where the
    computational fields become more diverse and inclusive. Of course,
    diversity extends beyond gender, the same arguments can -- and
    should -- be made about ethnicity, age, religion, sexual identity,
    etc. Being a white woman living in Sweden, I fully acknowledge my
    privileges, and that my encounters with prejudice are probably
    dwarfed by those from other -- less fortunate -- groups. Still, I
    can only speak of my own experiences and observations.

-   <span style="color:#1eff00">**Breaking the limit**.</span> My third, and final, wish for the future is
    to pass the qualifying time for the Boston Marathon. To then -- of
    course -- complete the race.
